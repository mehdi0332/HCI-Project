Normally this task through an application is performed as; booking system is the same as a user book on a specific bus service website. That’s why u have no need to use Laptop, Pc, etc. You can book tickets on one click user only can book and reserves their seats while sitting at homes. Quickest and safest way to book bus tickets and with the application user can find the current quantity of people inside the bus to lead them to avoid wasted time knowing that they wait for the bus that packs of passengers.

This task is done through some devices with the help of these devices, The application can show updated estimation time arrival and the number of persons inside the bus. It uses two devices embedded inside the bus, which are GPS Tracker device and IoT people counter device. All devices will transmit the data into a cloud database which is Firebase. The user will receive the data transmitted from the database. Other than that, They will know the timely arrival of the bus.
