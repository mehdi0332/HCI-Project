## Domain Description ##
We have Selected the domain of Technology for this project we make a Mobile Application, We select this domain and idea because It often happens to us that when we are in a rush/hurry and we have to go to somewhere like office & university but we are not getting a bus or the bus have already left the stop when we reach there and we do not even know when the next bus will arrive or is there any other bus that can take us to our destination and being on time makes us suffer from embarrassment. So in order to overcome this problem we want to make a application that will never make you miss the bus. And you'll be able to go everywhere on time and it will also allow you keep track of all the buses and its routes.
